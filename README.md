## About

This game was created while studying at Ironhack Lisbon in under two weeks, and was the first project developed there. The requirements were to use Javascript, DOM Manipulation, CSS, and HTML Canvas to create a game of our choosing.

## Controls :joystick:

Use the space bar to catch fish! Simple as that.

## Technologies Used

Fisherman's Horizon is written in vanilla Javascript, and uses HTML Canvas and CSS to present it as a browser game.
